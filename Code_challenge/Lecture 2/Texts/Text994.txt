Youth and white paper, as the proverb says, take all impressions. The
boy profited much by his father's precepts, and more by his example; he
always heard his father speak the truth, and saw that he dealt fairly
with everybody. In all his childish traffic, Francisco, imitating his
parents, was scrupulously honest, and therefore all his companions
trusted him--"As honest as Francisco," became a sort of proverb amongst
them. "As honest as Francisco," repeated Piedro's father, when he one day heard
this saying. "Let them say so; I say, 'As sharp as Piedro'; and let us
see which will go through the world best." With the idea of making his
son SHARP he made him cunning. He taught him, that to make a GOOD
BARGAIN was to deceive as to the value and price of whatever he wanted to
dispose of; to get as much money as possible from customers by taking
advantage of their ignorance or of their confidence. He often repeated
his favourite proverb--"The buyer has need of a hundred eyes; the seller
has need but of one." *  And he took frequent opportunities of explaining
the meaning of this maxim to his son. He was a fisherman; and as his
gains depended more upon fortune than upon prudence, he trusted
habitually to his good luck. After being idle for a whole day, he would
cast his line or his nets, and if he was lucky enough to catch a fine
fish, he would go and show it in triumph to his neighbour the gardener. * Chi compra ha bisogna di cent' occhi; chi vende n'ha assai di uno. "You are obliged to work all day long for your daily bread," he would
say. "Look here; I work but five minutes, and I have not only daily
bread, but daily fish." Upon these occasions, our fisherman always forgot, or neglected to count,
the hours and days which were wasted in waiting for a fair wind to put to
sea, or angling in vain on the shore. Little Piedro, who used to bask in the sun upon the sea-shore beside his
father, and to lounge or sleep away his time in a fishing-boat, acquired
habits of idleness, which seemed to his father of little consequence
whilst he was BUT A CHILD. "What will you do with Piedro as he grows up, neighbour?" said the
gardener. "He is smart and quick enough, but he is always in mischief. Scarcely a day has passed for this fortnight but I have caught him
amongst my grapes. I track his footsteps all over my vineyard." "HE IS BUT A CHILD yet, and knows no better," replied the fisherman. "But if you don't teach him better now he is a child, how will he know
when he is a man?" said the gardener. "A mighty noise about a bunch of grapes, truly!" cried the fisherman:  "a
few grapes more or less in your vineyard, what does it signify?" "I speak for your son's sake, and not for the sake of my grapes," said
the gardener; "and I tell you again, the boy will not do well in the
world, neighbour, if you don't look after him in time." "He'll do well enough in the world, you will find," answered the
fisherman, carelessly. "Whenever he casts my nets, they never come up
empty. 'It is better to be lucky than wise.'" *

* E meglio esser fortunato che savio. This was a proverb which Piedro had frequently heard from his father, and
to which he most willingly trusted, because it gave him less trouble to
fancy himself fortunate than to make himself wise. "Come here, child," said his father to him, when he returned home after
the preceding conversation with the gardener; "how old are you, my boy?--
twelve years old, is not it?" "As old as Francisco, and older by six months," said Piedro. "And smarter and more knowing by six years," said his father. "Here,
take these fish to Naples, and let us see how you'll sell them for me. Venture a small fish, as the proverb says, to catch a great one. *  I was
too late with them at the market yesterday, but nobody will know but what
they are just fresh out of the water, unless you go and tell them." * Butta una sardella per pigliar un luccio. "Not I; trust me for that; I'm not such a fool," replied Piedro,
laughing; "I leave that to Francisco. Do you know, I saw him the other
day miss selling a melon for his father by turning the bruised side to
the customer, who was just laying down the money for it, and who was a
raw servant-boy, moreover--one who would never have guessed there were
two sides to a melon, if he had not, as you say, father, been told of
it?" "Off with you to market. You are a droll chap," said his father, "and
will sell my fish cleverly, I'll be bound. As to the rest, let every man
take care of his own grapes. You understand me, Piedro?" "Perfectly," said the boy, who perceived that his father was indifferent
as to his honesty, provided he sold fish at the highest price possible. He proceeded to the market, and he offered his fish with assiduity to
every person whom he thought likely to buy it, especially to those upon
whom he thought he could impose. He positively asserted to all who
looked at his fish, that they were just fresh out of the water. Good
judges of men and fish knew that he said what was false, and passed him
by with neglect; but it was at last what he called GOOD LUCK to meet with
the very same young raw servant-boy who would have bought the bruised
melon from Francisco. He made up to him directly, crying, "Fish! Fine
fresh fish! fresh fish!" "Was it caught to-day?" said the boy. "Yes, this morning; not an hour ago," said Piedro, with the greatest
effrontery. The servant-boy was imposed upon; and being a foreigner, speaking the
Italian language but imperfectly, and not being expert at reckoning the
Italian money, he was no match for the cunning Piedro, who cheated him
not only as to the freshness, but as to the price of the commodity. Piedro received nearly half as much again for his fish as he ought to
have done. On his road homewards from Naples to the little village of Resina, where
his father lived, he overtook Francisco, who was leading his father's
ass. The ass was laden with large panniers, which were filled with the
stalks and leaves of cauliflowers, cabbages, broccoli, lettuces, etc.--
all the refuse of the Neapolitan kitchens, which are usually collected by
the gardeners' boys, and carried to the gardens round Naples, to be mixed
with other manure. "Well filled panniers, truly," said Piedro, as he overtook Francisco and
the ass. The panniers were indeed not only filled to the top, but piled
up with much skill and care, so that the load met over the animal's back. "It is not a very heavy load for the ass, though it looks so large," said
Francisco. "The poor fellow, however, shall have a little of this
water," added he, leading the ass to a pool by the roadside. "I was not thinking of the ass, boy; I was not thinking of any ass, but
of you, when I said, 'Well filled panniers, truly!' This is your
morning's work, I presume, and you'll make another journey to Naples to-
day, on the same errand, I warrant, before your father thinks you have
done enough?" "Not before MY FATHER thinks I have done enough, but before I think so
myself," replied Francisco. "I do enough to satisfy myself and my father, too," said Piedro, "without
slaving myself after your fashion. Look here," producing the money he
had received for the fish; "all this was had for asking. It is no bad
thing, you'll allow, to know how to ask for money properly." "I should be ashamed to beg, or borrow either," said Francisco. "Neither did I get what you see by begging, or borrowing either," said
Piedro, "but by using my wits; not as you did yesterday, when, like a
novice, you showed the bruised side of your melon, and so spoiled your
market by your wisdom." "Wisdom I think it still," said Francisco. "And your father?" asked Piedro. "And my father," said Francisco. "Mine is of a different way of thinking," said Piedro. "He always tells
me that the buyer has need of a hundred eyes, and if one can blind the
whole hundred, so much the better. You must know, I got off the fish to-
day that my father could not sell yesterday in the market--got it off for
fresh just out of the river--got twice as much as the market price for
it; and from whom, think you? Why, from the very booby that would have
bought the bruised melon for a sound one if you would have let him. You'll allow I'm no fool, Francisco, and that I'm in a fair way to grow
rich, if I go on as I have begun." "Stay," said Francisco; "you forgot that the booby you took in to-day
will not be so easily taken in to-morrow. He will buy no more fish from
you, because he will be afraid of your cheating him; but he will be ready
enough to buy fruit from me, because he will know I shall not cheat him--
so you'll have lost a customer, and I gained one." "With all my heart," said Piedro. "One customer does not make a market;
if he buys no more from me, what care I? there are people enough to buy
fish in Naples." "And do you mean to serve them all in the same manner?" asked Francisco. "If they will be only so good as to give me leave," said Piedro,
laughing, and repeating his father's proverb, "'Venture a small fish to
catch a large one.'" *  He had learned to think that to cheat in making
bargains was witty and clever. * see anted. "And you have never considered, then," said Francisco, "that all these
people will, one after another, find you out in time?" "Ay, in time; but it will be some time first. There are a great many of
them, enough to last me all the summer, if I lose a customer a day," said
Piedro. "And next summer," observed Francisco, "what will you do?" "Next summer is not come yet; there is time enough to think what I shall
do before next summer comes. Why, now, suppose the blockheads, after
they had been taken in and found it out, all joined against me, and would
buy none of our fish--what then? Are there no trades but that of a
fisherman? In Naples, are there not a hundred ways of making money for a
smart lad like me? as my father says. What do you think of turning
merchant, and selling sugar-plums and cakes to the children in their
market?
