Instead of admiring the good sense and steadiness of this little lad,
Archer suffered Townsend to snatch the untasted bun out of his hands. He
flung it at a hole in the window, but it fell back. The Archers
scrambled for it, and Fisher ate it. Archer saw this, and was sensible that he had not done handsomely in
suffering it. A few moments ago he had admired his own generosity, and
though he had felt the injustice of others, he had not accused himself of
any. He turned away from the little boy, and sitting down at one end of
the table, hid his face in his hands. He continued immovable in this
posture for some time. "Lord!" said Townsend; "it was an excellent joke!" "Pooh!" said Fisher; "what a fool, to think so much about a bun!" "Never mind, Mr. Archer, if you are thinking about me," said the little
boy, trying gently to pull his hands from his face. Archer stooped down, and lifted him up upon the table, at which sight the
partisans set up a general hiss. "He has forsaken us! He deserts his
party! He wants to be a Greybeard! After he has got us all into this
scrape, he will leave us!" "I am not going to leave you," cried Archer. "No one shall ever accuse
me of deserting my party. I'll stick by the Archers, right or wrong, I
tell you, to the last moment. But this little fellow--take it as you
please, mutiny if you will, and throw me out of the window. Call me
traitor! coward! Greybeard!--this little fellow is worth you all put
together, and I'll stand by him against anyone who dares to lay a finger
upon him; and the next morsel of food that I see shall be his. Touch him
who dares!" The commanding air with which Archer spoke and looked, and the belief
that the little boy deserved his protection, silenced the crowd. But the
storm was only hushed. No sound of merriment was now to be heard--no battledore and shuttlecock-
-no ball, no marbles. Some sat in a corner, whispering their wishes that
Archer would unbar the doors, and give up. Others, stretching their
arms, and gaping as they sauntered up and down the room, wished for air,
or food, or water. Fisher and his nine, who had such firm dependence
upon the gipsy, now gave themselves up to utter despair. It was eight
o'clock, growing darker and darker every minute, and no candles, no light
could they have. The prospect of another long dark night made them still
more discontented. Townsend, at the head of the yawners, and Fisher, at the head of the
hungry malcontents, gathered round Archer and the few yet unconquered
spirits, demanding "How long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon? and whether he expected that they should starve themselves for his sake?" The idea of GIVING UP was more intolerable to Archer than all the rest. He saw that the majority, his own convincing argument, was against him. He was therefore obliged to condescend to the arts of persuasion. He
flattered some with hopes of food from the town boys. Some he reminded
of their promises; others he praised for former prowess; and others he
shamed by the repetition of their high vaunts in the beginning of the
business. It was at length resolved that at all events they WOULD HOLD OUT. With
this determination they stretched themselves again to sleep, for the
second night, in weak and weary obstinacy. Archer slept longer and more soundly than usual the next morning, and
when he awoke, he found his hands tied behind him! Three or four boys
had just got hold of his feet, which they pressed down, whilst the
trembling hands of Fisher were fastening the cord round them. With all the force which rage could inspire, Archer struggled and roared
to "HIS ARCHERS!" --his friends, his party--for help against the traitors. But all kept aloof. Townsend, in particular, stood laughing and looking
on. "I beg your pardon, Archer, but really you look so droll. All alive
and kicking! Don't be angry. I'm so weak, I cannot help laughing
today." The packthread cracked. "His hands are free! He's loose!" cried the
least of the boys, and ran away, whilst Archer leaped up, and seizing
hold of Fisher with a powerful grasp, sternly demanded "What he meant by
this?" "Ask my party," said Fisher, terrified; "they set me on; ask my party." "Your party!" cried Archer, with a look of ineffable contempt; "you
reptile!--YOUR party? Can such a thing as YOU have a party?" "To be sure!" said Fisher, settling his collar, which Archer in his
surprise had let go; "to be sure! Why not? Any man who chooses it may
have a party as well as yourself, I suppose. I have nine Fishermen." At these words, spoken with much sullen importance, Archer, in spite of
his vexation, could not help laughing. "Fishermen!" cried he,
"FISHERMEN!" "And why not Fishermen as well as Archers?" cried they. "One party is
just as good as another; it is only a question which can get the upper
hand; and we had your hands tied just now." "That's right, Townsend," said Archer, "laugh on, my boy! Friend or foe,
it's all the same to you. I know how to value your friendship now. You
are a mighty good fellow when the sun shines; but let a storm come, and
how you slink away!" At this instant, Archer felt the difference between A GOOD COMPANION and
a good friend, a difference which some people do not discover till late
in life. "Have I no friend?--no real friend amongst you all? And could ye stand
by, and see my hands tied behind me like a thief's? What signifies such
a party--all mute?" "We want something to eat," answered the Fishermen. "What signifies SUCH
a party, indeed? and SUCH a manager, who can do nothing for one?" "And have _I_ done nothing?" "Don't let's hear any more prosing," said Fisher; "we are too many for
you. I've advised my party, if they've a mind not to be starved, to give
you up for the ringleader, as you were; and Dr. Middleton will not let us
all off, I daresay." So, depending upon the sullen silence of the
assembly, he again approached Archer with a cord. A cry of "No, no, no! Don't tie him," was feebly raised. Archer stood still, but the moment Fisher touched him he knocked him down
to the ground, and turning to the rest, with eyes sparkling with
indignation, "Archers!" cried he. A voice at this instant was heard at
the door. It was De Grey's voice. "I have got a large basket of
provisions for your breakfast." A general shout of joy was sent forth by
the voracious public. "Breakfast! Provisions! A large basket! De Grey
for ever! Huzza!" De Grey promised, upon his honour, that if he would unbar the door nobody
should come in with him, and no advantage should be taken of them.
