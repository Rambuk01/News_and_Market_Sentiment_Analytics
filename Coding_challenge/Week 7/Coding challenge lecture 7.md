**Submit here: [Challenge Submission Form](https://forms.gle/WmSEkZn8WH1fiDjE6)**

## Challenge Details

- Make sure you can run [Lecture 7 - Sentiment analysis/Code/Training_sentiment.py](https://github.com/christianvedels/News_and_Market_Sentiment_Analytics/blob/main/Lecture%207%20-%20Sentiment%20analysis/Code/Training_sentiment.py) 
- If it takes too long then you might want to limit the data to the first 2000 observations
- Add named entity recognition to find out which entities have high/low sentiment associated with it
- Try to run a local copy of LLaMA2 using [Lecture 7 - Sentiment analysis/Code/Using_LLAMA2.py](https://github.com/christianvedels/News_and_Market_Sentiment_Analytics/blob/main/Lecture%207%20-%20Sentiment%20analysis/Code/Using_LLAMA2.py). Note that you need to ask for access.
- Can you prompt it to return sentiments?
