- Introduction to basic tools
- A lot of not so interesting things. But you can refer back to this. 

### What we covered:
- `str` and what you can do with it
- Text cleaning (dealing with strange characters, stopwords, etc.)
- Lexical resources (AFINN) 
- Classical sentiment analysis
- Coding challenge: Zipf"s law

# The Naïve Bayes classifier (1/2)
.pull-left-wide[
.small123[
- We can infer $P(Class|X)$ via $P(Class|X)$
- In the Naïve Bayes classifier, we assume features are conditionally independent given the class, simplifying the calculation: $P(X|Class) = P(x_1|Class) \cdot P(x_2|Class) \cdot \ldots$
- Simple and very widely used classifier 
- $X$ is the features 
  + $P(Class|x_i) = P(x|Class)P(Class)/P(x_i)$ (Bayes" law)
  + $P(x_i|Class)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j\in Class} 1[x_j]$
  + $P(Class)$ can be assumed or estimated; $P(x_i)$ can also be estimated
  
- Assumes independence between features

- We will walk over intuition in the following slides

# The Naïve Bayes classifier (2/2)

.small123[
- This and similar approaches used extensively for feature extraction and in social science research
  + The maths is simple and clear, which helps in Causal Inference applications 
  + We want to know the *kinds of errors* more rather than *minimizing the errors*
  + Sometimes works really well
- Two examples: 
  + Bentzen & Andersen (2022): More religious names are associated with less technological development
  + Bentzen, Boberg-Fazlic, Sharp, Skovsgaard, Vedel (2024): Certain Danish religious movements is associated with less integration into the US in 1800s. But this seemingly has little consequences for occupational outcomes.
  
- Always start with NB when dealing with textual data
- But do use other models as well :-)

# NB intuition: Genders from names (1/5)

.pull-left-wide[
- We want to classify a name as either *male* or *female* 
- **Training data:** A list of of female / male names
- **Goal:** Use this data to produce a classifier
- **Note:** We do not need any fancy neural nets. We just need basic probability theory. 
]

class: middle
# NB intuition: Genders from names (2/5)
- Say we observe 20000 names - 10000 for each gender
- **What we observe:** The frequency of names among genders
  + "Carl" might appear 1023/10000 times as male and 3/10000 times as female in our data
  + "Carla" has a might appear 2148/10000 times as male and 5/10000 times as female in our data
  + Etc.
  
- **We can derive** an estimate of $Pr(Gender | Name)$:
  + $Pr(Name = \text{"Carl"} | Gender = \text{"Male"}) \approx 1023 / 10000 = 0.1023$
  + $Pr(Name = \text{"Carl"} | Gender = \text{"Female"}) \approx 3 / 10000 = 0.0003$
  + $Pr(Name = \text{"Carla"} | Gender = \text{"Male"}) \approx 5 / 10000 = 0.0005$
  + $Pr(Name = \text{"Carla"} | Gender = \text{"Female"}) \approx 2148 / 10000 = 0.2148$ 
  + *Repeat for all names and classes* 
- This is the "training" procedure for NB

# NB intuition: Genders from names (3/5)

.pull-left-wide[
- **What we have:** An estimate of $Pr(Name | Gender)$
- **What we want:** An estimate of $Pr(Gender | Name)$

- **Solution:** Bayes" law: $Pr(Gender | Name) = \frac{Pr(Name | Gender) Pr(Gender)}{Pr(Name)}$

# NB intuition: Genders from names (4/5)

*We will calculate the probability that "Carla" is female*

--
#### 1. Assume $Pr(Gender = \text{"Female"}) = 0.5$ (Is this reasonable?)

--
#### 2. Calculate $Pr(Name = \text{"Carla"})$

--

$$Pr(Name) = \sum_{Gender} Pr(Name | Gender) Pr(Gender)$$

--

$$Pr(Name = \text{"Carla"}) = Pr(\text{"Carla"} | \text{"Female"}) Pr(\text{"Female"}) + Pr(\text{"Carla"} | \text{"Male"}) Pr(\text{"Male"})$$

--

$$Pr(Name = \text{"Carla"}) = 0.2148 \times 0.5 + 0.0005 \times 0.5$$

--

$$Pr(Name = \text{"Carla"}) = 0.10765$$

--
#### 3. Retrieve $Pr(Name = \text{"Carla"} | Gender = \text{"Female"}) = 0.2148$ from "training"


---
# NB intuition: Genders from names (5/5)

--
#### 4. Putting it all together

--

$$Pr(Gender = \text{"Female"} | Name = \text{"Carla"}) = \frac{Pr(\text{"Carla"} | \text{"Female"}) Pr(\text{"Female"})}{Pr(\text{"Carla"})}$$

--

$$Pr(Gender = \text{"Female"} | Name = \text{"Carla"}) = \frac{0.2148 \times 0.5}{0.10765}$$

--

$$Pr(Gender = \text{"Female"} | Name = \text{"Carla"}) = \frac{0.10740}{0.10765}$$


--
### Result:

$$Pr(Gender = \text{"Female"} | Name = \text{"Carla"}) = 0.998$$


*Note: Simple to automate and **fast** to compute*

---
# A real application 
.pull-left-wide[
- Census data can be the source of knowledge about long run development
- Census data does not always contain genders 
- We can use the gender information in names 
- Used via a Naive-Bayes classifier 
- This time using the entire name

- **Turns out:** We can obtain 98.1% accuracy with Naïve-Bayes
