MRS. BUSTLE, landlady of the "Saracen's Head." JUSTICE HEADSTRONG. OLD MAN. WILLIAM, a Servant. SCENE I. The House of Justice Headstrong--a hall--Lucy watering some myrtles--A
servant behind the scenes is heard to say--

I tell you my master is not up. You can't see him, so go about your
business, I say. Lucy. To whom are you speaking, William? Who's that? Will. Only an old man, miss, with a complaint for my master. Lucy. Oh, then, don't send him away--don't send him away. Will. But master has not had his chocolate, ma'am. He won't ever see
anybody before he drinks his chocolate, you know, ma'am. Lucy. But let the old man, then, come in here. Perhaps he can wait a
little while. Call him. (Exit Servant.) (Lucy sings, and goes on watering her myrtles; the servant shows in the
Old Man.) Will. You can't see my master this hour; but miss will let you stay
here. Lucy (aside). Poor old man! how he trembles as he walks. (Aloud.) Sit
down, sit down. My father will see you soon; pray sit down. (He hesitates; she pushes a chair towards him.) Lucy. Pray sit down. (He sits down.) Old Man. You are very good, miss; very good. (Lucy goes to her myrtles
again.) Lucy. Ah! I'm afraid this poor myrtle is quite dead--quite dead. (The Old Man sighs, and she turns round.) Lucy (aside). I wonder what can make him sigh so! (Aloud.) My father
won't make you wait long. Old M.  Oh, ma'am, as long as he pleases. I'm in no haste--no haste. It's only a small matter. Lucy. But does a small matter make you sigh so? Old M.  Ah, miss; because, though it is a small matter in itself, it is
not a small matter to me (sighing again); it was my all, and I've lost
it. Lucy. What do you mean? What have you lost? Old M.  Why, miss--but I won't trouble you about it. Lucy. But it won't trouble me at all--I mean, I wish to hear it; so tell
it me. Old M.  Why, miss, I slept last night at the inn here, in town--the
"Saracen's Head"--

Lucy (interrupts him). Hark! there is my father coming downstairs;
follow me. You may tell me your story as we go along. Old M.  I slept at the "Saracen's Head," miss, and--
                                          (Exit, talking.) SCENE II. Justice Headstrong's Study. (He appears in his nightgown and cap, with his gouty foot upon a stool--a
table and chocolate beside him--Lucy is leaning on the arm of his chair.) Just. Well, well, my darling, presently; I'll see him presently. Lucy. Whilst you are drinking your chocolate, papa? Just. No, no, no--I never see anybody till I have done my chocolate,
darling. (He tastes his chocolate.) There's no sugar in this, child. Lucy. Yes, indeed, papa. Just. No, child--there's NO sugar, I tell you; that poz! Lucy. Oh, but, papa, I assure you I put in two lumps myself. Just. There's NO sugar, I say; why will you contradict me, child, for
ever? There's no sugar, I say. (Lucy leans over him playfully, and with his teaspoon pulls out two lumps
of sugar.) Lucy. What's this, papa? Just. Pshaw! pshaw! pshaw!--it is not melted, child--it is the same as
no sugar!.--Oh, my foot, girl, my foot!--you kill me. Go, go, I'm busy. I've business to do. Go and send William to me; do you hear, love? Lucy. And the old man, papa? Just. What old man? I tell you what, I've been plagued ever since I was
awake, and before I was awake, about that old man. If he can't wait, let
him go about his business. Don't you know, child, I never see anybody
till I've drunk my chocolate; and I never will, if it were a duke--that's
poz!
