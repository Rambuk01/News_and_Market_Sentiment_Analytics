"I happy am,
 Joy is my name." Sweet joy befall thee! Pretty joy! Sweet joy, but two days old. Sweet Joy I call thee:
 Thou dost smile,
 I sing the while;
 Sweet joy befall thee! A DREAM
 
 Once a dream did weave a shade
 O'er my angel-guarded bed,
 That an emmet lost its way
 Where on grass methought I lay. Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,
 Dark, benighted, travel-worn,
 Over many a tangle spray,
 All heart-broke, I heard her say:
 
 "Oh my children! do they cry,
 Do they hear their father sigh? Now they look abroad to see,
 Now return and weep for me." Pitying, I dropped a tear:
 But I saw a glow-worm near,
 Who replied, "What wailing wight
 Calls the watchman of the night? "I am set to light the ground,
 While the beetle goes his round:
 Follow now the beetle's hum;
 Little wanderer, hie thee home!" ON ANOTHER'S SORROW
 
 Can I see another's woe,
 And not be in sorrow too? Can I see another's grief,
 And not seek for kind relief? Can I see a falling tear,
 And not feel my sorrow's share? Can a father see his child
 Weep, nor be with sorrow filled? Can a mother sit and hear
 An infant groan, an infant fear? No, no! never can it be! Never, never can it be! And can He who smiles on all
 Hear the wren with sorrows small,
 Hear the small bird's grief and care,
 Hear the woes that infants bear --
 
 And not sit beside the next,
 Pouring pity in their breast,
 And not sit the cradle near,
 Weeping tear on infant's tear? And not sit both night and day,
 Wiping all our tears away? Oh no! never can it be! Never, never can it be! He doth give his joy to all:
 He becomes an infant small,
 He becomes a man of woe,
 He doth feel the sorrow too. Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,
 And thy Maker is not by:
 Think not thou canst weep a tear,
 And thy Maker is not year. Oh He gives to us his joy,
 That our grief He may destroy:
 Till our grief is fled an gone
 He doth sit by us and moan. SONGS OF EXPERIENCE
 
 
 INTRODUCTION
 
 Hear the voice of the Bard,
 Who present, past, and future, sees;
 Whose ears have heard
 The Holy Word
 That walked among the ancient tree;
 
 Calling the lapsed soul,
 And weeping in the evening dew;
 That might control
 The starry pole,
 And fallen, fallen light renew! "O Earth, O Earth, return! Arise from out the dewy grass! Night is worn,
 And the morn
 Rises from the slumbrous mass. "Turn away no more;
 Why wilt thou turn away? The starry floor,
 The watery shore,
 Are given thee till the break of day." EARTH'S ANSWER
 
 Earth raised up her head
 From the darkness dread and drear,
 Her light fled,
 Stony, dread,
 And her locks covered with grey despair. "Prisoned on watery shore,
 Starry jealousy does keep my den
 Cold and hoar;
 Weeping o're,
 I hear the father of the ancient men. "Selfish father of men! Cruel, jealous, selfish fear! Can delight,
 Chained in night,
 The virgins of youth and morning bear? "Does spring hide its joy,
 When buds and blossoms grow? Does the sower 
 Sow by night,
 Or the plowman in darkness plough? "Break this heavy chain,
 That does freeze my bones around! Selfish, vain,
 Eternal bane,
 That free love with bondage bound." THE CLOD AND THE PEBBLE
 
 "Love seeketh not itself to please,
   Nor for itself hath any care,
 But for another gives it ease,
   And builds a heaven in hell's despair." So sang a little clod of clay,
   Trodden with the cattle's feet,
 But a pebble of the brook
   Warbled out these metres meet:
 
 "Love seeketh only Self to please,
   To bind another to its delight,
 Joys in another's loss of ease,
   And builds a hell in heaven's despite." HOLY THURSDAY
 
 Is this a holy thing to see
   In a rich and fruitful land, --
 Babes reduced to misery,
   Fed with cold and usurous hand? Is that trembling cry a song? Can it be a song of joy? And so many children poor? It is a land of poverty! And their son does never shine,
   And their fields are bleak and bare,
 And their ways are filled with thorns:
   It is eternal winter there. For where'er the sun does shine,
   And where'er the rain does fall,
 Babes should never hunger there,
   Nor poverty the mind appall. THE LITTLE GIRL LOST
 
 In futurity
 I prophetic see
 That the earth from sleep
 (Grave the sentence deep)
 
 Shall arise, and seek
 for her Maker meek;
 And the desert wild
 Become a garden mild. In the southern clime,
 Where the summer's prime
 Never fades away,
 Lovely Lyca lay. Seven summers old
 Lovely Lyca told. She had wandered long,
 Hearing wild birds' song. "Sweet sleep, come to me
 Underneath this tree;
 Do father, mother, weep? Where can Lyca sleep? "Lost in desert wild
 Is your little child. How can Lyca sleep
 If her mother weep? "If her heart does ache,
 Then let Lyca wake;
 If my mother sleep,
 Lyca shall not weep. "Frowning, frowning night,
 O'er this desert bright
 Let thy moon arise,
 While I close my eyes." Sleeping Lyca lay
 While the beasts of prey,
 Come from caverns deep,
 Viewed the maid asleep. The kingly lion stood,
 And the virgin viewed:
 Then he gambolled round
 O'er the hallowed ground. Leopards, tigers, play
 Round her as she lay;
 While the lion old
 Bowed his mane of gold,
 
 And her breast did lick
 And upon her neck,
 From his eyes of flame,
 Ruby tears there came;
 
 While the lioness
 Loosed her slender dress,
 And naked they conveyed
 To caves the sleeping maid. THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND
 
 All the night in woe
 Lyca's parents go
 Over valleys deep,
 While the deserts weep. Tired and woe-begone,
 Hoarse with making moan,
 Arm in arm, seven days
 They traced the desert ways. Seven nights they sleep
 Among shadows deep,
 And dream they see their child
 Starved in desert wild. Pale through pathless ways
 The fancied image strays,
 Famished, weeping, weak,
 With hollow piteous shriek. Rising from unrest,
 The trembling woman presse
 With feet of weary woe;
 She could no further go. In his arms he bore
 Her, armed with sorrow sore;
 Till before their way
 A couching lion lay. Turning back was vain:
 Soon his heavy mane
 Bore them to the ground,
 Then he stalked around,
 
 Smelling to his prey;
 But their fears allay
 When he licks their hands,
 And silent by them stands. They look upon his eyes,
 Filled with deep surprise;
 And wondering behold
 A spirit armed in gold. On his head a crown,
 On his shoulders down
 Flowed his golden hair. Gone was all their care. "Follow me," he said;
 "Weep not for the maid;
 In my palace deep,
 Lyca lies asleep." Then they followed
 Where the vision led,
 And saw their sleeping child
 Among tigers wild. To this day they dwell
 In a lonely dell,
 Nor fear the wolvish howl
 Nor the lion's growl. THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER
 
 A little black thing in the snow,
 Crying "weep! weep!" in notes of woe! "Where are thy father and mother? Say!" --
 "They are both gone up to the church to pray. "Because I was happy upon the heath,
 And smiled among the winter's snow,
 They clothed me in the clothes of death,
 And taught me to sing the notes of woe. "And because I am happy and dance and sing,
 They think they have done me no injury,
 And are gone to praise God and his priest and king,
 Who make up a heaven of our misery." NURSE'S SONG
 
 When voices of children are heard on the green,
 And whisperings are in the dale,
 The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,
 My face turns green and pale. Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
 And the dews of night arise;
 Your spring and your day are wasted in play,
 And your winter and night in disguise. THE SICK ROSE
 
 O rose, thou art sick! The invisible worm,
 That flies in the night,
   In the howling storm,
 
 Has found out thy bed
   Of crimson joy,
 And his dark secret love
   Does thy life destroy. THE FLY
 
 Little Fly,
 Thy summer's play
 My thoughtless hand
 Has brushed away. Am not I
 A fly like thee? Or art not thou
 A man like me? For I dance
 And drink, and sing,
 Till some blind hand
 Shall brush my wing. If thought is life
 And strength and breath
 And the want 
 Of thought is death;
 
 Then am I
 A happy fly,
 If I live,
 Or if I die. THE ANGEL
 
 I dreamt a dream! What can it mean? And that I was a maiden Queen
 Guarded by an Angel mild:
 Witless woe was ne'er beguiled! And I wept both night and day,
 And he wiped my tears away;
 And I wept both day and night,
 And hid from him my heart's delight. So he took his wings, and fled;
 Then the morn blushed rosy red. I dried my tears, and armed my fears
 With ten-thousand shields and spears.
