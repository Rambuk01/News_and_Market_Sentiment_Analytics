3:35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most
High, 3:36 To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not. 3:37 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord
commandeth it not? 3:38 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth
not evil and good? 3:39 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man
for the punishment of his sins? 3:40 Let us search and try our ways,
and turn again to the LORD. 3:41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. 3:42 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. 3:43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain,
thou hast not pitied. 3:44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should
not pass through. 3:45 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of
the people. 3:46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 3:47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. 3:48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of
the daughter of my people. 3:49 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any
intermission. 3:50 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. 3:51 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my
city. 3:52 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. 3:53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon
me. 3:54 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off. 3:55 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. 3:56 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at
my cry. 3:57 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou
saidst, Fear not. 3:58 O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast
redeemed my life. 3:59 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. 3:60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations
against me. 3:61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their
imaginations against me; 3:62 The lips of those that rose up against
me, and their device against me all the day. 3:63 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their
musick. 3:64 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of
their hands. 3:65 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. 3:66 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the
LORD. 4:1 How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the
stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street. 4:2 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they
esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! 4:3 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their
young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the
ostriches in the wilderness. 4:4 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth
for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto
them. 4:5 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they
that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. 4:6 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is
greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown
as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her. 4:7 Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk,
they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of
sapphire: 4:8 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known
in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it
is become like a stick. 4:9 They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be
slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of
the fruits of the field. 4:10 The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:
they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 4:11 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his
fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured
the foundations thereof. 4:12 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,
would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have
entered into the gates of Jerusalem. 4:13 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,
that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, 4:14 They
have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted
themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments. 4:15 They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart,
touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the
heathen, They shall no more sojourn there. 4:16 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard
them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not
the elders. 4:17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us. 4:18 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is
near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. 4:19 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they
pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the
wilderness. 4:20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken
in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among
the heathen. 4:21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the
land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be
drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. 4:22 The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of
Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit
thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins. 5:1 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our
reproach. 5:2 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. 5:3 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. 5:4 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. 5:5 Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest. 5:6 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to
be satisfied with bread. 5:7 Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their
iniquities. 5:8 Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us
out of their hand. 5:9 We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword
of the wilderness. 5:10 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine. 5:11 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of
Judah. 5:12 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not
honoured. 5:13 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the
wood. 5:14 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their
musick. 5:15 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into
mourning. 5:16 The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have
sinned! 5:17 For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes
are dim. 5:18 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes
walk upon it. 5:19 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to
generation. 5:20 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long
time? 5:21 Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned;
renew our days as of old. 5:22 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us. The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel


1:1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month,
in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river
of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. 1:2 In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king
Jehoiachin's captivity, 1:3 The word of the LORD came expressly unto
Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by
the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him. 1:4 And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a
great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about
it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the
midst of the fire. 1:5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a
man. 1:6 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. 1:7 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was
like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of
burnished brass. 1:8 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four
sides; and they four had their faces and their wings. 1:9 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they
went; they went every one straight forward. 1:10 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a
man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the
face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an
eagle. 1:11 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two
wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their
bodies. 1:12 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was
to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. 1:13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was
like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went
up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and
out of the fire went forth lightning. 1:14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a
flash of lightning. 1:15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the
earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. 1:16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the
colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their
appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a
wheel. 1:17 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned
not when they went. 1:18 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful;
and their rings were full of eyes round about them four. 1:19 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and
when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels
were lifted up. 1:20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their
spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the
spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 1:21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood;
and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted
up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the
wheels. 1:22 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth
over their heads above. 1:23 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward
the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every
one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. 1:24 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the
noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of
speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their
wings. 1:25 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their
heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings. 1:26 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the
likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon
the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man
above upon it.
