11:41 Then
they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And
Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou
hast heard me. 11:42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast
sent me. 11:43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
Lazarus, come forth. 11:44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith
unto them, Loose him, and let him go. 11:45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
things which Jesus did, believed on him. 11:46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them
what things Jesus had done. 11:47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and
said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. 11:48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the
Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. 11:49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same
year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, 11:50 Nor consider that
it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and
that the whole nation perish not. 11:51 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that
year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; 11:52 And
not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in
one the children of God that were scattered abroad. 11:53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put
him to death. 11:54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called
Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. 11:55 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of
the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. 11:56 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they
stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the
feast? 11:57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a
commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it,
that they might take him. 12:1 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where
Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 12:2 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was
one of them that sat at the table with him. 12:3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and
anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the
house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 12:4 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,
which should betray him, 12:5 Why was not this ointment sold for three
hundred pence, and given to the poor? 12:6 This he said, not that he
cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and
bare what was put therein. 12:7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying
hath she kept this. 12:8 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. 12:9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and
they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus
also, whom he had raised from the dead. 12:10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also
to death; 12:11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went
away, and believed on Jesus. 12:12 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when
they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 12:13 Took branches of
palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is
the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. 12:14 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is
written, 12:15 Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh,
sitting on an ass's colt. 12:16 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when
Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were
written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. 12:17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus
out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. 12:18 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that
he had done this miracle. 12:19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how
ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. 12:20 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship
at the feast: 12:21 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of
Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see
Jesus. 12:22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip
tell Jesus. 12:23 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son
of man should be glorified. 12:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into
the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth
much fruit. 12:25 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his
life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. 12:26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there
shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father
honour. 12:27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me
from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. 12:28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. 12:29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it
thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. 12:30 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but
for your sakes. 12:31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this
world be cast out. 12:32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto
me. 12:33 This he said, signifying what death he should die. 12:34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be
lifted up? who is this Son of man? 12:35 Then Jesus said unto them,
Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that
walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. 12:36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the
children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did
hide himself from them. 12:37 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
believed not on him: 12:38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might
be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and
to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? 12:39 Therefore they
could not believe, because that Esaias said again, 12:40 He hath
blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see
with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted,
and I should heal them. 12:41 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of
him. 12:42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;
but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they
should be put out of the synagogue: 12:43 For they loved the praise of
men more than the praise of God. 12:44 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on
me, but on him that sent me. 12:45 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. 12:46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me
should not abide in darkness. 12:47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not:
for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. 12:48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in
the last day. 12:49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,
he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. 12:50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever
I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. 13:1 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his
hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father,
having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the
end. 13:2 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart
of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; 13:3 Jesus knowing that
the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come
from God, and went to God; 13:4 He riseth from supper, and laid aside
his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. 13:5 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the
disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was
girded. 13:6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord,
dost thou wash my feet? 13:7 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I
do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 13:8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 13:9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my
hands and my head. 13:10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash
his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. 13:11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not
all clean. 13:12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,
and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to
you? 13:13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. 13:14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also
ought to wash one another's feet. 13:15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
done to you. 13:16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than
his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. 13:17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. 13:18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the
scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted
up his heel against me. 13:19 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye
may believe that I am he. 13:20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I
send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent
me. 13:21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you
shall betray me. 13:22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he
spake. 13:23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom
Jesus loved. 13:24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it
should be of whom he spake. 13:25 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 13:26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I
have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas
Iscariot, the son of Simon. 13:27 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto
him, That thou doest, do quickly. 13:28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto
him. 13:29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus
had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the
feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. 13:30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was
night. 13:31 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of
man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 13:32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in
himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
