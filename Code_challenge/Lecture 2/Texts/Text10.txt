28:1 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest,
if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit. 28:2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I
lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle. 28:3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in
their hearts. 28:4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their
hands; render to them their desert. 28:5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation
of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up. 28:6 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
supplications. 28:7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him,
and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my
song will I praise him. 28:8 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his
anointed. 28:9 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and
lift them up for ever. 29:1 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
strength. 29:2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD
in the beauty of holiness. 29:3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters. 29:4 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full
of majesty. 29:5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh
the cedars of Lebanon. 29:6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like
a young unicorn. 29:7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. 29:8 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
the wilderness of Kadesh. 29:9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth
the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. 29:10 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for
ever. 29:11 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless
his people with peace. 30:1 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast
not made my foes to rejoice over me. 30:2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. 30:3 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast
kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 30:4 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
remembrance of his holiness. 30:5 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. 30:6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. 30:7 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong:
thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled. 30:8 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication. 30:9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? 30:10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper. 30:11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put
off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

30:12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. 31:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
deliver me in thy righteousness. 31:2 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong
rock, for an house of defence to save me. 31:3 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's
sake lead me, and guide me. 31:4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
thou art my strength. 31:5 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD
God of truth. 31:6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the
LORD. 31:7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered
my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

31:8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set
my feet in a large room. 31:9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly. 31:10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my
strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed. 31:11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me
without fled from me. 31:12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
vessel. 31:13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:
while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away
my life. 31:14 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God. 31:15 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
enemies, and from them that persecute me. 31:16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
mercies' sake. 31:17 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let
the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave. 31:18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. 31:19 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee
before the sons of men! 31:20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the
strife of tongues. 31:21 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
kindness in a strong city. 31:22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried
unto thee. 31:23 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the
faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer. 31:24 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye
that hope in the LORD. 32:1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
covered. 32:2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and
in whose spirit there is no guile. 32:3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
the day long. 32:4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
turned into the drought of summer. Selah. 32:5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou
forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 32:6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time
when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they
shall not come nigh unto him. 32:7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. 32:8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt
go: I will guide thee with mine eye. 32:9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
they come near unto thee. 32:10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the
LORD, mercy shall compass him about. 32:11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for
joy, all ye that are upright in heart. 33:1 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the
upright. 33:2 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an
instrument of ten strings. 33:3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. 33:4 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in
truth. 33:5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
goodness of the LORD. 33:6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host
of them by the breath of his mouth. 33:7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth
up the depth in storehouses. 33:8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the
world stand in awe of him. 33:9 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. 33:10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
maketh the devices of the people of none effect. 33:11 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
heart to all generations. 33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom
he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 33:13 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. 33:14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
inhabitants of the earth. 33:15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
works. 33:16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man
is not delivered by much strength. 33:17 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver
any by his great strength. 33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
them that hope in his mercy;

33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
famine. 33:20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. 33:21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in
his holy name. 33:22 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee. 34:1 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually
be in my mouth. 34:2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear
thereof, and be glad. 34:3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. 34:4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my
fears. 34:5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were
not ashamed. 34:6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of
all his troubles. 34:7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him,
and delivereth them.
