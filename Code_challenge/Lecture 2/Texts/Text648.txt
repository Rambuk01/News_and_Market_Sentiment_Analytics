'Twas all a mistake. So now don't you go and make
a mistake into a misunderstanding. It was I made every word of the song
out o' the face*--that about the back that never was bent, and the
ancestors of the oyster, and all. He did not waste a word of it; upon my
conscience, I wrote it all--though I'll engage you didn't think I could
write a good thing. (Lord John turns away.) I'm telling you the truth,
and not a word of a lie, and yet you won't believe me. *From beginning to end. Lord J. You will excuse me, sir, if I cannot believe two contradictory
assertions within two minutes. Mr. Talbot, I thank you (going). (Rory tries to stop Lord John from going, but cannot.--Exit Lord John.) Rory. Well, if he WILL go, let him go then, and much good may it do him. Nay, but don't you go too. Talb. O Rory, what have you done?--(Talbot runs after Lord J.) Hear me,
my lord. (Exit Talbot.) Rory. Hear him! hear him! hear him!--Well, I'm point blank mad with
myself for making this blunder; but how could I help it? As sure as ever
I am meaning to do the best thing on earth, it turns out the worst. Enter a party of lads, huzzaing. Rory (joins.) Huzza! huzza!--Who, pray, are ye huzzaing for? 1st Boy. Wheeler! Wheeler for ever! huzza! Rory. Talbot! Talbot for ever! huzza! Captain Talbot for ever! huzza! 2nd Boy. CAPTAIN he'll never be,--at least not to-morrow; for Lord John
has just declared for Wheeler. lst Boy. And that turns the scale. Rory. Oh, the scale may turn back again. 3rd Boy. Impossible! Lord John has just given his promise to Wheeler. I heard him with my own ears. (Several speak at once.) And I heard him; and I! and I! and I!--Huzza! Wheeler for ever! Rory. Oh, murder! murder! murder! (Aside.) This goes to my heart! it's
all my doing. O, my poor Talbot!-- murder! murder! murder! But I won't
let them see me cast down, and it is good to be huzzaing at all events. Huzza for Talbot! Talbot for ever! huzza! (Exit.) Enter WHEELER and BURSAL. Wheel. Who was that huzzaing for Talbot? (Rory behind the scenes, "Huzza for Talbot! Talbot for ever! huzza!") Burs. Pooh, it is only Rory O'Ryan, or the roaring lion as I call him. Ha! ha! ha! Rory O'Ryan, alias O'Ryan, the roaring lion; that's a good
one; put it about--Rory O'Ryan, the roaring lion, ha! ha! ha! but you
don't take it--you don't laugh, Wheeler. Wheeler. Ha! ha! ha! O, upon my honour I do laugh; ha! ha! ha! (Aside). It is the hardest work to laugh at his wit. (Aloud.) Rory
O'Ryan, the roaring lion--ha! ha! ha! You know I always laugh, Bursal,
at your jokes--he! he! he!--ready to kill myself. Burs. (sullenly).
