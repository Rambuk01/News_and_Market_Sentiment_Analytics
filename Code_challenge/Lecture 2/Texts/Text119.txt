24:3 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is
established: 24:4 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with
all precious and pleasant riches. 24:5 A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth
strength. 24:6 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of
counsellors there is safety. 24:7 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the
gate. 24:8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. 24:9 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an
abomination to men. 24:10 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. 24:11 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and
those that are ready to be slain; 24:12 If thou sayest, Behold, we
knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he
that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to
every man according to his works? 24:13 My son, eat thou honey,
because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:
24:14 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou
hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall
not be cut off. 24:15 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the
righteous; spoil not his resting place: 24:16 For a just man falleth
seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into
mischief. 24:17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be
glad when he stumbleth: 24:18 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease
him, and he turn away his wrath from him. 24:19 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at
the wicked: 24:20 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the
candle of the wicked shall be put out. 24:21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with
them that are given to change: 24:22 For their calamity shall rise
suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? 24:23 These things
also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in
judgment. 24:24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall the
people curse, nations shall abhor him: 24:25 But to them that rebuke
him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. 24:26 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer. 24:27 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the
field; and afterwards build thine house. 24:28 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and
deceive not with thy lips. 24:29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will
render to the man according to his work. 24:30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the
man void of understanding; 24:31 And, lo, it was all grown over with
thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall
thereof was broken down. 24:32 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and
received instruction. 24:33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
hands to sleep: 24:34 So shall thy poverty come as one that
travelleth; and thy want as an armed man. 25:1 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah
king of Judah copied out. 25:2 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of
kings is to search out a matter. 25:3 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of
kings is unsearchable. 25:4 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a
vessel for the finer. 25:5 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall
be established in righteousness. 25:6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not
in the place of great men: 25:7 For better it is that it be said unto
thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the
presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. 25:8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in
the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. 25:9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a
secret to another: 25:10 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame,
and thine infamy turn not away. 25:11 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of
silver. 25:12 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a
wise reprover upon an obedient ear. 25:13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his
masters. 25:14 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind
without rain. 25:15 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue
breaketh the bone. 25:16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. 25:17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary
of thee, and so hate thee. 25:18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a
maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. 25:19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a
broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. 25:20 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar
upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. 25:21 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be
thirsty, give him water to drink: 25:22 For thou shalt heap coals of
fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. 25:23 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a
backbiting tongue. 25:24 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a
brawling woman and in a wide house. 25:25 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far
country. 25:26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled
fountain, and a corrupt spring. 25:27 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own
glory is not glory. 25:28 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is
broken down, and without walls. 26:1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not
seemly for a fool. 26:2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse
causeless shall not come. 26:3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the
fool's back. 26:4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like
unto him. 26:5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own
conceit. 26:6 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the
feet, and drinketh damage. 26:7 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth
of fools. 26:8 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth
honour to a fool. 26:9 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable
in the mouths of fools. 26:10 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool,
and rewardeth transgressors. 26:11 As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his
folly. 26:12 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of
a fool than of him. 26:13 The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in
the streets. 26:14 As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon
his bed. 26:15 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to
bring it again to his mouth. 26:16 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can
render a reason. 26:17 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to
him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. 26:18 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, 26:19 So
is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? 26:20 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no
talebearer, the strife ceaseth. 26:21 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a
contentious man to kindle strife. 26:22 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
the innermost parts of the belly. 26:23 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with
silver dross. 26:24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit
within him; 26:25 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there
are seven abominations in his heart. 26:26 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
shewed before the whole congregation. 26:27 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a
stone, it will return upon him. 26:28 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a
flattering mouth worketh ruin. 27:1 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day
may bring forth. 27:2 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger,
and not thine own lips. 27:3 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is
heavier than them both. 27:4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand
before envy? 27:5 Open rebuke is better than secret love. 27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy
are deceitful. 27:7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every
bitter thing is sweet. 27:8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that
wandereth from his place. 27:9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of
a man's friend by hearty counsel. 27:10 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither
go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is
a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. 27:11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him
that reproacheth me. 27:12 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the
simple pass on, and are punished. 27:13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a
pledge of him for a strange woman. 27:14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in
the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. 27:15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman
are alike. 27:16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his
right hand, which bewrayeth itself. 27:17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his
friend. 27:18 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he
that waiteth on his master shall be honoured. 27:19 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. 27:20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are
never satisfied. 27:21 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a
man to his praise. 27:22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a
pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
