50:17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind
thee. 50:18 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
hast been partaker with adulterers. 50:19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. 50:20 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
thine own mother's son. 50:21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee,
and set them in order before thine eyes. 50:22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
pieces, and there be none to deliver. 50:23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God. 51:1 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions. 51:2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 51:3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
me. 51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be
clear when thou judgest. 51:5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
conceive me. 51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall
be whiter than snow. 51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice. 51:9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
within me. 51:11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit
from me. 51:12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy
free spirit. 51:13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
converted unto thee. 51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 51:15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
praise. 51:16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
delightest not in burnt offering. 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 51:18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of
Jerusalem. 51:19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer
bullocks upon thine altar. 52:1 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness
of God endureth continually. 52:2 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
deceitfully. 52:3 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak
righteousness. Selah. 52:4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue. 52:5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of
the land of the living. Selah. 52:6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:

52:7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted
in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his
wickedness. 52:8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in
the mercy of God for ever and ever. 52:9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I
will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints. 53:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth
good. 53:2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if
there were any that did understand, that did seek God. 53:3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 53:4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people
as they eat bread: they have not called upon God. 53:5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put
them to shame, because God hath despised them. 53:6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God
bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and
Israel shall be glad. 54:1 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. 54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 54:3 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after
my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 54:4 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my
soul. 54:5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
truth. 54:6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
LORD; for it is good. 54:7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath
seen his desire upon mine enemies. 55:1 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
supplication. 55:2 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a
noise;

55:3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of
the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. 55:4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are
fallen upon me. 55:5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
overwhelmed me. 55:6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly
away, and be at rest. 55:7 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah. 55:8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. 55:9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
violence and strife in the city. 55:10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief
also and sorrow are in the midst of it. 55:11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not
from her streets. 55:12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself
against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

55:13 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
acquaintance. 55:14 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God
in company. 55:15 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell:
for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. 55:16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me. 55:17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
and he shall hear my voice. 55:18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
against me: for there were many with me. 55:19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. 55:20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
him: he hath broken his covenant. 55:21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in
his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. 55:22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he
shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. 55:23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their
days; but I will trust in thee. 56:1 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
fighting daily oppresseth me. 56:2 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that
fight against me, O thou most High. 56:3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. 56:4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will
not fear what flesh can do unto me. 56:5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me
for evil. 56:6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark
my steps, when they wait for my soul. 56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
people, O God. 56:8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:
are they not in thy book? 56:9 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I
know; for God is for me. 56:10 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his
word. 56:11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do
unto me. 56:12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. 56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou
deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light
of the living? 57:1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my
refuge, until these calamities be overpast. 57:2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
things for me. 57:3 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him
that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and
his truth. 57:4 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on
fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and
their tongue a sharp sword. 57:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above
all the earth.
